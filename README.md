Hello! I’m Brad, a front-end web developer. I really enjoy prograamming and utilizing the power of the computer.
My journey in web development has been driven by an endless enthusiasm for building interesting projects. Over the past 20 years, I’ve used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with popular frameworks like React and Node.
As I continue to grow in the field, I am excited about expanding my expertise into full-stack development.
My goal is to gain proficiency in back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB.
I’m eager to understand the entire web development lifecycle, from server-side logic to front-end interfaces. 
My approach to learning is hands-on. I’m excited about the challenge of becoming a full-stack developer and am committed to continuous learning and growth in this dynamic field.
