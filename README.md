My name is Brad Seftel, I have  a strong foundation in  front-end technologies like HTML, Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript. I am also comfortable with Arch Linux and working in the command line with git, ssh and much more.

Currently I am building an online shopping application using NodeJS and MongoDB. To see examples of my work please visit my website www.brad-seftel.com
