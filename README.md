My name is Brad Seftel, I have  a strong foundation in  front-end technologies like HTML, Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript. I am also comfortable with Arch Linux and working in the command line with git, ssh and remote log in and configuring. I am currently learning Nodejs and MongoDB. 

Currently I am building a project and deciding on best technologies to use. MERN is one consideration but I am also exploring the MEVN stack. which feels for me to be a better fit. The main difference of course is React or Vue.

I am familiar with git and GitHub. To see examples of my work please visit my website www.brad-seftel.com where you may link to my work via GitHub. You can follow my current work here.
